# Discussion Back Button Feature Implementation

## Todo Items

- [x] Examine discussion detail route component and add back button
- [x] Update discussion view component with back button
- [x] Test navigation functionality
- [x] Run linting to ensure code quality
- [x] Create review section in todo.md

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. **Updated DiscussionView Component** (`src/features/discussions/components/discussion-view.tsx`)
   - Added imports for `ArrowLeft` icon from `lucide-react`, `useNavigate` from `react-router`, `Button` component, and `paths` configuration
   - Added `useNavigate` hook to enable programmatic navigation
   - Added back button with:
     - `ArrowLeft` icon for visual clarity
     - "Back to Discussions" text
     - `ghost` variant for subtle appearance
     - `sm` size for compact design
     - Click handler that navigates to discussions listing page using `paths.app.discussions.getHref()`

### Code Changes Summary

**File**: `src/features/discussions/components/discussion-view.tsx`
- **Lines 1-11**: Added new imports for navigation functionality and UI components
- **Lines 14-17**: Added `useNavigate` hook
- **Lines 33-42**: Added back button with icon and navigation handler

### Technical Decisions

1. **Placement**: Back button positioned at the top of the discussion view for immediate visibility
2. **Styling**: Used `ghost` variant for subtle appearance that doesn't compete with main content
3. **Icon**: Used `ArrowLeft` from `lucide-react` for consistent iconography with the rest of the app
4. **Navigation**: Used `paths.app.discussions.getHref()` for type-safe routing

### Security Review

✅ **No security vulnerabilities introduced**
- No sensitive information exposed in the frontend
- Uses existing, secure navigation patterns
- No user input processing or data validation concerns
- Follows existing application security practices

### Testing Status

✅ **All checks passed**
- Linting: No errors or warnings
- Navigation path validation: Correctly configured
- Component integration: Properly integrated with existing discussion view
