*Generated from comprehensive QA testing analysis on 2025-07-12*

## Current Testing State
- **Overall Coverage**: 76%
- **Route Coverage**: 50% (8/16 endpoints tested)
- **Security Tests**: 15%
- **Performance Tests**: 0%

## ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL - Immediate Priority**

### 1. Missing Route Test Coverage
- [ ] **Users Routes** (`src/routes/__tests__/users.test.ts`)
  - [ ] `GET /users` - Get team members
  - [ ] `PATCH /users/profile` - Update user profile  
  - [ ] `DELETE /users/:userId` - Delete user (admin only)
  - [ ] Edge cases: email conflicts, invalid user IDs, cross-team access attempts

- [ ] **Comments Routes** (`src/routes/__tests__/comments.test.ts`)
  - [ ] `GET /comments` - Get comments with pagination
  - [ ] `POST /comments` - Create comment
  - [ ] `DELETE /comments/:id` - Delete comment
  - [ ] Edge cases: invalid discussion IDs, comment ownership validation

- [ ] **Teams Routes** (`src/routes/__tests__/teams.test.ts`)
  - [ ] `GET /teams` - Get all teams (for registration)
  - [ ] Edge cases: empty teams list, database errors

### 2. Security Testing Critical Gaps
- [ ] **Authentication Edge Cases**
  - [ ] Malformed JWT tokens
  - [ ] Expired JWT tokens  
  - [ ] Missing/empty Authorization headers
  - [ ] JWT signature tampering attempts

- [ ] **Authorization Bypass Tests**
  - [ ] Regular user attempting admin operations
  - [ ] Cross-team data access attempts
  - [ ] Privilege escalation attempts
  - [ ] Resource ownership validation

- [ ] **Multi-Team Data Isolation**
  - [ ] User from Team A accessing Team B discussions
  - [ ] User from Team A accessing Team B comments  
  - [ ] User from Team A accessing Team B members
  - [ ] Admin from Team A managing Team B users

## ðŸŸ¡ **HIGH PRIORITY - Within Sprint**

### 3. Integration Testing Enhancements
- [ ] **Database Constraint Testing**
  - [ ] Foreign key violation scenarios
  - [ ] Unique constraint violations
  - [ ] Database transaction rollback scenarios

- [ ] **Error Handling Coverage**
  - [ ] Database connection failures
  - [ ] Network timeout simulations
  - [ ] Invalid request payload scenarios
  - [ ] Large payload handling (>10MB)

### 4. Performance Testing Framework
- [ ] **Load Testing Setup**
  - [ ] Install artillery or k6 for load testing
  - [ ] Create performance test scenarios
  - [ ] Set up performance CI pipeline

- [ ] **Critical Performance Tests**
  - [ ] 100+ concurrent users creating discussions
  - [ ] Database connection pool stress testing
  - [ ] Large comment threads (1000+ comments)
  - [ ] Pagination performance with large datasets

### 5. Input Validation & Security
- [ ] **Boundary Testing**
  - [ ] Maximum field length validation
  - [ ] SQL injection attempt simulation
  - [ ] XSS payload testing in discussion/comment bodies
  - [ ] File upload security (if applicable)

- [ ] **Rate Limiting Validation**
  - [ ] Verify rate limits are enforced (100 req/15min)
  - [ ] Test rate limit bypass attempts
  - [ ] Validate rate limit headers in responses

## ðŸŸ¢ **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Next Quarter**

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement
- [ ] **GitHub Actions Setup**
  - [ ] Create `.github/workflows/test.yml`
  - [ ] Add quality gates (minimum 90% coverage)
  - [ ] Add security scanning (SAST with CodeQL)
  - [ ] Add dependency vulnerability scanning

- [ ] **Environment-Specific Testing**
  - [ ] Staging environment test suite
  - [ ] Production smoke tests
  - [ ] Database migration testing

### 7. Advanced Testing Scenarios
- [ ] **Concurrent Operations**
  - [ ] Race condition testing (simultaneous user creation)
  - [ ] Concurrent comment creation on same discussion
  - [ ] Parallel discussion updates by different admins

- [ ] **Memory & Resource Testing**
  - [ ] Memory leak detection during long-running tests
  - [ ] Resource cleanup validation
  - [ ] Database connection pool monitoring

### 8. End-to-End Testing
- [ ] **Full User Journey Tests**
  - [ ] Complete registration â†’ discussion creation â†’ commenting flow
  - [ ] Admin workflow: user management â†’ content moderation
  - [ ] Multi-user collaboration scenarios

## ðŸ›  **Implementation Notes**

### Test Utilities to Create
- [ ] `createTestComment()` - Already exists in factories.ts
- [ ] `createMultipleUsers()` - For team testing
- [ ] `createLargeDataset()` - For performance testing
- [ ] `simulateNetworkError()` - For error testing

### Configuration Updates Needed
- [ ] Update `jest.config.js` for performance test exclusion
- [ ] Add test environment variables for load testing
- [ ] Configure test database for performance scenarios

### Dependencies to Add
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "artillery": "^2.0.0",
    "@types/artillery": "^1.7.0",
    "jest-performance": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```
